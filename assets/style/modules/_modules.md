# Modules

A good starting point to style **external modules**.
By external I mean any markup not generated by the theme, this is a good place to style:
 
* WordPress Gallery
* Screen reader text
* WordPress Captions
* WordPress alignment (.alignleft, .alignright...)
* Any supported plugins, possibly in a /modules/plugins/ directory
