# Site
This is where you can write your site styles. Go crazy ðŸ™‚

For convenience, it's split into a few subfolders out of the box:

* **global** - your header, footer, any other elements that are repeating from page-to-page
* **partials** - elements that appear here and there, but not on all pages. For example pagination, content navigation, etc. 
* **primary** - the primary content area, everything inside the `#primary.site-content`
* **secondary** - secondary content, like widgets, sidebars. etc.
